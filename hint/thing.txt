( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 


processes to test:

create a first user
1st user log in
1st user create hint
1st user create treasure
1st user log out
create second user
2nd user log in
2nd user solve hint
2nd user solve treasure
2nd user log out

also look at points, history, and any other page from the user
vs non users page.
